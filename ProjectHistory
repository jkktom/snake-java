## App Location Update
- Relocated App.java to dedicated snake package (com.snake.App)
- Established proper main entry point structure
- Removed incorrect plan to move App.java to view layer
- App.class will be built to build/com/snake/App.class

## Directory Structure Creation
- Created all planned directories without moving files:
  - src/DB_source for database files
  - src/main/java/com/* for Java packages
  - docs/ for documentation
  - resources/images/ for assets
- Project remains functional with original files in place
- Prepared for gradual file migration

## Project Restructuring Branch
- Created new branch 'restructure-project' for safe refactoring
- Will implement directory structure changes here
- Plan to merge back to master when restructuring is complete and tested
- Allows for safe rollback if needed

[Commit: ec8a22e]
## Model Classes Creation
- Created core game model classes:
  - Snake: Main snake entity with movement and AI status
  - GameResult: Record for game outcome data
  - Food: Food entity with position and value
  - Tile: Enum for board tile types
  - Direction: Enum for movement directions
- Added user-related models:
  - User: Player profile with game history
  - Comment: User feedback and game comments
- All models created with proper encapsulation and immutability where appropriate
- Models designed for future database integration
